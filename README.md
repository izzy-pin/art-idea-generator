# An idea that exists only in this generator ðŸŒ– ðŸŒ‘ ðŸŒ”

> **â€œthe reason to copy your heroes and their style is so that you might somehow get a glimpse into their minds"** - Austin Kleon, _Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative_

## An art concept generator built using React, inspired by the writings of artist [Katie Paterson](http://katiepaterson.org/)

- Users can select an art medium and randomly generate a piece of work on that theme.
- Ideas can be deleted in batches by selecting disliked ones or start afresh by clearing all.
- Local storage is used to make ideas persist between sessions.
- The background image changes daily, using nasa's Astronomy Picture of the Day API.
- - If an error occurs, a default image will display.
